{{/* Template for dumping variables
Can be used to print the content of a variable on the console
during helm install or helm upgrade
NOTE: The install/upgrade will fail at this point after printing the variable
Usage example:
{{- $myVar := (list "a" 1 "x" (dict "x1" nil)) }}
{{- template "print.var_dump" $myVar }}

Gives the following output:
[
  "a",
  1,
  "x",
  {
    "x1": null
  }
]
*/}}

{{- define "print.var_dump" -}}
{{- . | mustToPrettyJson | printf "\nThe JSON output of the dumped var is: \n%s" | fail }}
{{- end -}}
