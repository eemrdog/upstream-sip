# Watch Dog Certificate (wdc) for probing the sip-tls functionality.
#
# SIP-TLS should renew this certificate frequently provided that the sip-tls
# is working properly. If the renewal process fails and this certificate expires
# then an alarm is raised with diagnostic information about the sip-tls system status
# and long-lived emergency certificates are deployed for all
# internal certificates in the system.
