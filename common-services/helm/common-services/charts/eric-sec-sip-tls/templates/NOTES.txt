Installation of "{{ .Chart.Name }}" is complete and the deployment is named "{{ .Release.Name }}" in the namespace "{{ .Release.Namespace }}".

SIP-TLS is supporting High Availability using leader-election approach. It is possible to check the leader pod for each container with:
    kubectl get pods -l "eric-sec-sip-tls-ha-leader-follower-label in (leader)"
    kubectl get pods -l "eric-sec-sip-tls-supervisor-ha-leader-follower-label in (leader)"

Deletion of SIP-TLS will cause all dependent services to stop working after certificates have expired.
It is therefore adviced to delete dependent services first, otherwise the generated secrets needs to be cleaned up manually.

The following commands give a hint of what would need cleanup after SIP-TLS deletion:

    kubectl get secret -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} -l com.ericsson.sec.tls/created-by={{ template "eric-sec-sip-tls.name" . }}
    kubectl get internalcertificates -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}
    kubectl get internaluserca -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

To delete SIP-TLS:
    helm uninstall {{ .Release.Name }} -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}
    kubectl delete secret -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} {{ template "eric-sec-sip-tls.name" . }}-trusted-root-cert

Service-specific secrets can be found by using the following label selector (replace <svc_common_name> with the common name you want to find):

    kubectl get secret -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} -l com.ericsson.sec.tls/created-for=<svc_common_name>


####

The following Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) *must* be installed before installing SIP-TLS, otherwise the SIP-TLS installation will fail:

    certificateauthorities.com.ericsson.sec.tls
    clientcertificates.com.ericsson.sec.tls
    servercertificates.com.ericsson.sec.tls
    internalcertificates.siptls.sec.ericsson.com
    internalusercas.siptls.sec.ericsson.com

Also, SIP-TLS *must* be installed together with Key Management Service and its dependent services, preferably as part of the same chart.
