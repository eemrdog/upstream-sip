Welcome to eric-data-search-engine on Kubernetes!
{{- if $g.security.tls.enabled }}
{{- if eq .Values.service.endpoints.rest.tls.enforced "optional" }}

Deployed in dual mode with both TLS and insecure REST interfaces expose.
This deployment mode is not completely secured and should only be used during upgrade scenario until all clients have migrated to TLS interface.
{{- else }}

{{- if eq .Values.service.endpoints.rest.tls.verifyClientCertificate "optional" }}

Deployed in semi-secure mode with TLS.
Client certificates are not required by server leaving service vulnerable to "man-in-the-middle" attacks and should only be used during upgrade scenario until all clients are updated to use trusted certificates to support mTLS.
{{- else }}

Deployed in secure mode with mTLS.
{{- end }}
{{- end }}
{{- else }}

Deployed in insecure mode without TLS which is only supported for test and demo purposes.
{{- end }}
